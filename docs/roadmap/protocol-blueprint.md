# Roadmap: the leanVM proof system on ArkLib

leanVM proves that a leanISA execution exists by committing the six M3 tables as one multilinear
polynomial and running, in order, a grand-product argument for the bus (GKR), one batched
sumcheck for the tables' constraints, a two-cell public-input check, the Flock argument for the
BLAKE2S rows, ring switching, and one WHIR opening; Fiat–Shamir over BLAKE2s makes it a
non-interactive proof. This roadmap builds that verifier in Lean 4 on ArkLib's interactive oracle
reduction (IOR) framework and states the two theorems that make it a proof system for the
constraint relation of the [leanISA roadmap](leanisa-blueprint.md):

```text
piop_perfectCompleteness :
  SatisfiedBy prog input w → the honest prover makes leanVmVerifier accept with probability 1
piop_rbrKnowledgeSoundness :
  for every prover, leanVmVerifier accepts → except with probability piopError sizes,
    the committed columns w satisfy SatisfiedBy prog input w
```

Both are stated in the *ideal oracle model*: the committed polynomial is an oracle the verifier
may evaluate, and the challenges are uniform. They are the proof-system half of target T4 of
[architecture.md](../architecture.md); composed with `constraintSoundness` (leanISA Layer 10)
the second becomes "an accepted proof has an execution". The non-interactive verifier `verify`,
the one the Rust prover's proofs are checked against, is specified in full and proved to be the
Fiat–Shamir compilation of that oracle verifier; its own security theorem is *conditional* on
three named upstream results (the WHIR opening, the Merkle/BCS compilation, and Fiat–Shamir in
the random-oracle model) that ArkLib does not yet prove. Each is an interface with an upstream
issue, never an axiom.

The route is chosen so that the **trusted surface** stays small and cites its source line: the
relation is Clean's `EnsembleWitness` under the leanISA `SatisfiedBy`, unchanged; every protocol
piece is an ArkLib `OracleReduction` with ArkLib's own `perfectCompleteness` and
`rbrKnowledgeSoundness`; and the generic pieces ArkLib lacks (grand products, batching, the
binary-field WHIR) are written in ArkLib's shape and upstreamed.

Suggested home: `LeanerVM/Protocol/` (assembly, leanVM-specific instances) with the Clean bridge
in `LeanerVM/Arithmetization/` and the transcribed constants in `LeanerVM/Parameters/`,
following [architecture.md](../architecture.md). Generic components live under
`LeanerVM/Protocol/Generic/` only until their ArkLib pull request merges.

This document is the specification. The Lean signatures pin the shapes most likely to drift;
they are not exhaustive. Where things stand is recorded separately in
[protocol-status.md](protocol-status.md), which is a snapshot and never the authority on what is
wanted. Work on a layer is claimed through the tracking issue
([#12](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/leanerVM/issues/12)); see
[How work is tracked](#how-work-is-tracked).

## For zkVM engineers

ArkLib formalizes a proof system as a chain of *reductions*. A reduction is a short interactive
protocol, with a fixed message schedule (`ProtocolSpec`), that turns a claim "the statement `x`
is in relation `R₁` with some witness" into a claim about a relation `R₂`, typically smaller:
sumcheck turns "this sum equals `T`" into "this polynomial has value `v` at the random point
`r`"; a random-linear-combination step turns ten claims into one. Some prover messages are
*oracles*: the verifier does not read the message, it queries it at points of its choosing. A
committed polynomial is exactly such an oracle. Two properties are proved per reduction and then
composed: **perfect completeness** (an honest prover always passes) and **round-by-round
knowledge soundness**, the standard form since [CCHLRR19]: an invariant on partial transcripts
that a cheating prover can only escape when a fresh verifier challenge lands badly, with an error
bound per challenge. Summing the bounds gives the interactive error; after Fiat–Shamir the
largest bound is what a random-oracle query buys the adversary. The knowledge part is
*straight-line*: an extractor reads the witness off the oracles, no rewinding.

Three things are built. **The relation**: the leanISA `SatisfiedBy` on Clean's
`EnsembleWitness`, viewed as polynomials: every constraint of every table is a polynomial of
degree at most two in the row's columns that vanishes on the table's hypercube, and every bus
tuple is a vector of such polynomials whose pushed and pulled multisets agree. **The oracle
protocol**: the leanVM protocol of specification §8, phase by phase, as ArkLib reductions over
one committed oracle `q` (the stacked columns), composed sequentially, with the master theorems
above. **The compilation**: WHIR realizes the oracle, Merkle trees realize WHIR's oracles, and a
BLAKE2s chain replaces the verifier's coins; `verify : Proof → Bool` is that compiled verifier,
executable, and is what Rust-produced proofs are checked against.

What a reader should expect to be proved without hypotheses: everything about the oracle
protocol, given ArkLib's framework and the two sumcheck/grand-product components this roadmap
contributes upstream. What is stated but conditional: the security of `verify` itself, which
rests on WHIR's soundness in the list-decoding regime, on Merkle extraction, and on Fiat–Shamir,
all three tracked as ArkLib work. What is not attempted here: recursion (T5, T6) and zero
knowledge (leanVM has none).

## Scope

### In scope

- ArkLib as a Lake dependency at `dca90385`, with the field, sampling and oracle-interface
  instances that make `E = GF(2^192)` a challenge space and the stacked columns an oracle;
- hypercube tables over `K` and `E`, stacking with selectors, the index column, the bytecode
  multilinear, and their evaluation identities;
- the polynomial view of a Clean `Ensemble`: constraint polynomials and flush tuples extracted
  from a component's operations, the degree bound, and the bridge lemma to Clean's row-wise
  `Constraints`;
- the M3 instance for leanISA: announced sizes, caps, stack and leaf layouts, the stack of an
  `EnsembleWitness`, and the extractor reading a witness back from the stack;
- a sumcheck for eq-weighted virtual polynomials with a terminal claim and back-loaded padding,
  and a batching component by powers of one challenge (generic; upstream);
- the fingerprinted grand product, its multiset lemma, and the batched radix-4 GKR (generic;
  upstream);
- the bus phase (§5.2–§5.4, §6), the table sumcheck (§5.5), the public-input check (§8.2), the
  claim pool and the opening sumcheck, as ArkLib reductions with perfect completeness and
  round-by-round knowledge soundness;
- the Flock and ring-switching *interface* consumed from the Flock roadmap (#3);
- the composed oracle protocol `leanVmPiop`, its honest prover, its error `piopError`, and the
  two master theorems;
- WHIR over Reed–Solomon codes in the novel polynomial basis of `K`, Merkle trees over BLAKE2s,
  and leanVM's WHIR parameters (Annex B; generic parts upstream, shared with #3);
- Fiat–Shamir with leanVM's BLAKE2s chain, the `Proof` object and its serialization, the
  executable `verify`, and the theorem that `verify` is the compiled oracle verifier;
- the conditional non-interactive theorems and the T4 corollary through `constraintSoundness`;
- executable fixtures: kernel-checked identities on small instances and a Rust-produced proof
  accepted by `verify`, with mutations rejected.

### Out of scope

- the tables, channels, `SatisfiedBy` and `AssignmentRepresents`: leanISA Layers 5–10 (#4);
  this roadmap consumes `SatisfiedBy` and changes nothing in it beyond the two requests in
  [Boundaries](#boundaries);
- the BLAKE2s Boolean circuit, Flock's zerocheck and lincheck, and ring switching: the Flock
  roadmap (#3); consumed here as one interface (Layer 9);
- witness generation from an execution (T2): the honest prover here starts from an
  `EnsembleWitness`;
- the recursion guest, deferred claims, the verifier-in-circuit (T5), and any extraction bridge
  across recursion (T6); `verify` is the *native* verifier, which evaluates the bytecode and
  Flock matrices itself, and is shaped so that the deferred variant is a one-function change;
- zero knowledge;
- proximity-gap and list-decoding theorems for Reed–Solomon codes (mutual correlated agreement
  up to the Johnson bound, [BCHKS25] Theorem 4.6): consumed as a coding-theory interface,
  tracked in ArkLib;
- Fiat–Shamir and BCS security in the random-oracle model, and the round-by-round to
  state-restoration implications: consumed as interfaces, tracked in ArkLib;
- performance of the honest prover: it is a specification that runs, not an implementation.

## Dependencies and exact contracts

A prerequisite below is a named declaration at a pinned revision, an earlier layer here or in
the leanISA roadmap, or a cited section of a source. The pins are in `upstreams.json` and
[dependencies.md](../dependencies.md): leanVM
[`a386121f`](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM/commit/a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2),
ArkLib
[`dca90385`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib/commit/dca90385fb40dd5eb8da9145da6348ed17f5cd8b),
CompPoly `3468b38c`, Clean `93c9d1ef`, VCVio `f9dc47d9` (through ArkLib), Lean `v4.33.1`.

**Prior work.** The earlier formalization of leanVM-a (the pre-leanISA design) in the private
repository `leanth` is surveyed in [leanth-reuse.md](leanth-reuse.md), layer by layer: what is
ported, what is a port source for a ledger item, what is only a pattern, and what is dropped and
why. Issues cite that page, never the private tree; derived material carries the credit line and
co-author trailers it prescribes.

### The leanVM specification and implementation

Two kinds of source, with opposite disciplines (the authoring skill `lean-spec-authoring` sets
the rules). **Category A** content — what the verifier accepts and why it is sound — is written
from the specification document first and then diffed against the Rust and the Python verifier;
the Lean is intended to become the standard. **Category B** content — transcript tags, absorption
order, message encodings, layouts, WHIR parameters, hash constants — is transcribed from its
source and is wrong if it deviates. Every module docstring names its category, its source section
or file and lines, and the pin.

### The leanISA roadmap

The relation and everything below it. Consumed as named declarations of the layers listed in
[Interfaces supplied to later work](leanisa-blueprint.md#interfaces-supplied-to-later-work);
nothing is restated here.

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `K`, `E`, `y`, `ofK`, `E.limb`, `E.ofLimbs`, `g`, `gpow`, `orderOf_g` (Layer 0) | The fields, limbs and generator. Challenges are `E`; columns are `K`; `gpow` is the index column. |
| `iv`, `sigma`, `compress` (Layer 1) | The compression the transcript, Merkle hashing and the Flock circuit share; the byte hasher (Layer 11 here) is the RFC 7693 wrapper over `compress` with the last-block flag only (finding R21). |
| `Program`, `PublicInput`, `word0`, `word1`, `minLogMem`, `maxLogMem`, `maxLogRows`, `maxLogBytecode`, `minLogRowsBlake2s` (Layer 2) | The public statement and the caps. |
| `encodeSlots` (Layer 4) | The bytecode multilinear is `encodeSlots` laid out on `2^(k_bc + 4)` points. |
| `leanIsaEnsemble`, `xorTable` … `blake2sTable`, `memTable`, `bytecodeTable`, `leanIsaVerifier` (Layers 6–8) | The components whose operations are read as polynomials (Layer 2 here). |
| `StatePull` … `BytecodePush`, `MemMsg`, `StateMsg`, `BytecodeMsg` (Layer 5) | The channel of an interaction names its domain separator and coordinate order on the 16-slot bus. |
| `SatisfiedBy`, `BalancedPair`, `CountsNonzero`, `Caps`, `imageOf` (Layer 8) | The relation. `Caps` is asked to include power-of-two heights ([Boundaries](#boundaries)). |
| `constraintSoundness`, `HasFillBlocks`, `constraintCompleteness` (Layer 10) | Consumed only by Layer 13. |

### ArkLib

ArkLib is a Lean `module` library, so every file here that imports it and not Clean may be a
`module`. ArkLib carries admitted theorems under a committed baseline
(`scripts/axiom_baseline.json`); a leanerVM declaration may not depend on one, because the kernel
axiom audit (`axiom-audit-root: LeanerVM`) rejects `sorryAx`. The second table lists the admitted
results this roadmap would otherwise consume and what replaces each.

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `ProtocolSpec n`, `Direction`, `MessageIdx`, `ChallengeIdx`, `FullTranscript`, `Transcript` (`OracleReduction/ProtocolSpec/Basic.lean`) | The message schedule of every reduction; challenges are `V_to_P` rounds. |
| `OracleInterface` with `Query`, `Response`, `answer` (`OracleReduction/OracleInterface.lean:53-73`) | The query type and answer of an oracle message. Layer 0 gives the stack the evaluation interface. |
| `Prover`, `Verifier`, `OracleVerifier`, `Reduction`, `OracleReduction`, `OracleProof` (`OracleReduction/Basic.lean:222-669`) | The carriers. An `OracleVerifier` receives challenges and queries; `outputOracle` names which oracles it hands on (`OracleOutputEmbedding`) or derives (`OracleOutputSimulation`). |
| `Reduction.completeness`, `perfectCompleteness`, `OracleReduction.perfectCompleteness` (`Security/Basic.lean:89-103, 460-469`) | Completeness: honest prover and verifier agree on the output statement and the output relation holds, with probability `≥ 1 - ε`; `ε : ℝ≥0`. |
| `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness`, `Extractor.Straightline` (`Security/Basic.lean:248-359`) | Knowledge soundness with a universal straight-line extractor. |
| `Verifier.KnowledgeStateFunction`, `Extractor.RoundByRound`, `rbrKnowledgeSoundness`, `rbrKnowledgeSoundnessWorstCase`, `rbrKnowledgeSoundnessWorstCase_implies_rbrKnowledgeSoundness` (`Security/RoundByRound.lean:77-190, 416, 534, 606`) | Round-by-round knowledge soundness, error `pSpec.ChallengeIdx → ℝ≥0`; the worst-case form is what each layer proves. |
| `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness_implies_rbrSoundness` (`Security/Implications.lean:85`) | Proved; used to state plain soundness as a corollary. |
| `OracleReduction.append`, `OracleReduction.seqCompose`, `ProtocolSpec.seqCompose` (`Composition/Sequential/Append/Basic.lean:709`, `General.lean:255`) | Sequential composition of the phases. |
| `Reduction.seqCompose_perfectCompleteness_of_pure`, `OracleReduction.append_perfectCompleteness_of_pure_verifiers`, `seqCompose_completeness_of_guarded_verifiers` (`Composition/Sequential/{Completeness,Append/Completeness,GuardedNary}.lean`) | Completeness composition, proved; needs pure prover output and pure or guarded verifiers, and suffix completeness from every deterministic shared-oracle state. |
| `Verifier.append_rbrSoundnessWorstCase_of_pure_first`, `Verifier.StateFunction.append` (`Composition/Sequential/Append/RoundByRound.lean:37`, `Append/StateFunction.lean:292`) | Round-by-round *soundness* composition, proved for a pure first verifier; the knowledge form is Layer 10's upstream contribution (ledger A2). |
| `Component.ReduceClaim`, `CheckClaim`, `RandomQuery`, `DoNothing` (`ProofSystem/Component/`) | Zero-round claim rewriting and checking, the final oracle query; all proved. |
| `Sumcheck.Spec.reduction`, `StatementRound`, `relationRound`, `Sumcheck.Domain` (`ProofSystem/Sumcheck/Spec/General.lean:171`, `SingleRound.lean:130-144`, `Domain.lean`) | The shape of a sumcheck statement and round; the leanVM sumcheck (Layer 4) reuses `Domain` and states its relations in this shape. |
| `MvPolynomial.MLE`, `eqPolynomial`, `eqTilde`, `eqTilde_append`, `MLE_eq_zero_iff`, `MLEEquivFin` (`Data/MvPolynomial/Multilinear.lean`) | Multilinear extensions and the equality kernel, proved; the bridge to CompPoly's tables is `CMlPolynomialEval.eval_eq_MvPolynomial_MLE` (`ToCompPoly/Multilinear/Basic.lean:56`). |
| `MvPolynomial.schwartz_zippel_counting`, `prob_eval_zero_le_div` (`Data/MvPolynomial/SchwartzZippelCounting.lean`) | Every per-challenge error bound. |
| `Reduction.fiatShamir`, `Verifier.fiatShamir`, `fsChallengeOracle` (`OracleReduction/FiatShamir/Basic.lean:114-138`) | The Fiat–Shamir transform as a definition; its security is ledger A5. |
| `Commitment.Scheme`, `binding`, `perfectCorrectness_of_opening_perfectCompleteness` (`Commitments/Functional/Basic.lean`) | The commitment interface WHIR's commit and open instantiate. |
| `ToyProblem.Codegen` (`ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Codegen.lean`) | The pattern for code-generation probes; copied for `verify` and the honest prover. |
| `SampleableType`, `uniformSample`, `$ᵗ` (VCVio `OracleComp/Constructions/SampleableType.lean:44`) | Challenge sampling; Layer 0 supplies the `E` instance. |

**Admitted at the pin, and what this roadmap does about it.** Each row is an ArkLib issue or
pull request to open (the tracker records the numbers); none is worked around by a local
hypothesis.

| Ledger | ArkLib state at `dca90385` | Needed by | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 sumcheck round-by-round knowledge soundness | `Sumcheck.Spec.SingleRound.verifier_rbrKnowledgeSoundness` and the lens instances are `sorry` | Layers 4, 5, 10 | Layer 4 proves the single-round bound for its own sumcheck shape and contributes it as the missing leaf. |
| A2 knowledge-soundness composition | `Verifier.append_knowledgeSoundness`, `append_rbrKnowledgeSoundness`, `seqCompose_rbrKnowledgeSoundness` are admitted (issue #676) | Layer 10 | Layer 10 proves the worst-case round-by-round *knowledge* append for a pure first verifier, mirroring the proved soundness version, and upstreams it. |
| A3 round-by-round implies plain | `rbrKnowledgeSoundness_implies_knowledgeSoundness`, `rbrSoundness_implies_soundness` admitted | Layer 12 (statement of the plain corollary) | The master theorems are stated round-by-round; the plain corollary is stated once the implication lands upstream. |
| A4 context lifting | every `liftContext_*` security theorem admitted | none | Not consumed: statements are shaped so that no lens is needed. |
| A5 Fiat–Shamir and BCS | `fiatShamir_completeness` admitted; `BCSTransform` commented out (issue #627); `DuplexSponge` security admitted | Layer 12 | Named interfaces `FiatShamirSecurity` and `BcsSecurity` with the upstream theorem as witness obligation; the *definitions* of the compiled verifier are consumed. |
| A6 grand product, GKR, batching, stacking | absent | Layers 1, 4, 5 | Written here in ArkLib's shape, upstreamed. |
| A7 WHIR, Merkle, BLAKE2s | absent (only coding-theory lemmas) | Layer 11 | Written here; the coding-theory theorem it needs is ledger A8. |
| A8 mutual correlated agreement up to Johnson | `rs_mcaError_le_in_johnson_range` is an external admit | Layer 11 | Interface `McaJohnson`, witness obligation [BCHKS25] Theorem 4.6 in ArkLib. |
| A9 ring switching packing leaves | `RingSwitching/Packing` leaves are `sorry`, and no `GF(2) → GF(2^64)` profile | Layer 9 | Owned by #3 (F5); consumed through the Flock interface. |

### CompPoly

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `BF64`, `BF64.Ext3`, `card_bf64`, `card_ext3`, `Ext.coeff`, `Ext.ofFn`, `Ext.eval₂`-style lifts | As in the leanISA roadmap; `Fintype.card E = 2^192` is the only cardinality fact the error bounds use. |
| `CMlPolynomialEval R n` (`Multilinear/Basic.lean:47`), `evalMle`, `evalMleLayer`, `evalMle_succ`, `eval₂Mle`, `eval_mle_eq_eval` | Hypercube tables and their multilinear evaluation, computable; `eval₂Mle` is the `K → E` lift; `evalMleLayer` fixes the first variable, which every sumcheck prover reuses. |
| `eqTilde`, `eqTilde_eq_prod`, `eqTilde_append`, `lagrangeBasis` (`Multilinear/Basic.lean:410-632`) | The equality kernel as a table; `eqTilde_append` is the block factorization of selectors. |
| `evalManyMleByLayers` (`Multilinear/ManyEval/`) | Many tables at one point: the column claims at the sumcheck's end. |
| `CPolynomial`, `Lagrange.interpolate` (`Univariate/`) | Round polynomials of a sumcheck as coefficient vectors. |
| `AdditiveNTT.{U, W, normalizedW, additiveNTT, computableAdditiveNTT}` (`Fields/Binary/AdditiveNTT/`) | The novel polynomial basis and the encoder of Annex B.3, generic over a basis; Layer 11 instantiates the `K` basis `x^0 … x^63`. |
| `CMlPolynomialEval.toMvPolynomialDeg1`, `equivMvPolynomialDeg1` (`Multilinear/Equiv.lean`) | Tables as Mathlib multilinears, for the identities proved in `MvPolynomial`. |

CompPoly has no hypercube sum, no pointwise product of tables, no `GF(2^8) ↪ E` embedding and no
Frobenius on `Ext`; the first two are Layer 1 here, the last two are #3's (F1). The eager
`Fintype BF64` instance (finding P3) still forbids a leanerVM executable; `verify` is exercised
by compile-time `#guard` and by the code-generation probes, not by a binary.

### Clean

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `Expression F` with `var`, `const`, `add`, `mul`; `Expression.eval : Environment F → Expression F → F` (`Circuit/Expression.lean:6-90`) | Constraints and tuple coordinates are syntax trees over the row variables; variable `i` is column `i`. |
| `Component.operations : Operations F`, `Operations.constraints : List (Expression F)`, `Operations.interactions : List (AbstractInteraction F)` (`Air/FlatComponent.lean:21`, `Circuit/Operations.lean:404-432`) | The row-independent constraint and flush lists of a component. |
| `constraintsHold_iff_forall_mem`, `Table.Constraints`, `Table.environment`, `Environment.fromArray` (`Operations.lean:168-182`, `FlatComponent.lean:151-186`, `Expression.lean:71`) | The row-wise meaning the polynomial view must agree with; out-of-range variables read `0`. |
| `AbstractInteraction` (`channel`, `mult : Expression F`, `msg : Vector (Expression F) arity`), `Interaction`, `AbstractInteraction.eval` (`Circuit/Channel.lean:101-105, 305-329`) | A flush as expressions and its value on a row. |
| `EnsembleWitness` (`tables : List (Table F)`, `data`, `publicInput`), `Table.table : List (Array F)`, `Table.width` (`Air/FlatEnsemble.lean:19-25`, `FlatComponent.lean:151-156`) | The witness. A table of height `2^τ` is `2^τ` rows of `width` cells; heights are not powers of two in Clean, hence the request in [Boundaries](#boundaries). |
| `Circuit.witgen` (`Circuit/WitnessGeneration.lean:82`) | Per-row witness generation; not consumed here (T2). |

Clean has no polynomial, degree, height or padding notion (findings C5, C6); Layer 2 supplies the
polynomial view and is Clean's upstream candidate.

### Mathlib

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `MvPolynomial`, `Polynomial.card_roots'`, `Polynomial.eq_of_degree_le_of_eval_finset_eq` | Degrees and root counts behind every Schwartz–Zippel step. |
| `UniqueFactorizationMonoid` on `MvPolynomial`, `Polynomial.Monic`, `Multiset.map`, `Multiset.prod` | Lemma 5.2: a product of distinct linear forms determines its multiset of factors. |
| `Finset.sum_product`, `Fintype.sum_pow`, `Finset.prod_pow_eq_pow_sum` | The hypercube identities of Layer 1. |

## Pinned conventions

| Subject | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Hypercube | `Fin (2^n)` indexes `{0,1}^n` with bit `k` = coordinate `k` (low bit first), the CompPoly and leanVM order. A point is `Vector E n` (CompPoly's shape; ArkLib's `Fin n → E` is `Vector.ofFn` away). |
| Tables | `Column n` wraps `CMlPolynomialEval K n` (values) in a structure, so that its evaluation oracle is disjoint from ArkLib's position-query interface on `Vector`; `ETable n := CMlPolynomialEval E n`. A "multilinear" is its value table; its extension is `evalMle`, lifted by `eval₂Mle` when the point is in `E`. |
| `eq` | `eq(r, x) = ∏ (1 + r_k + x_k)` over `E` (characteristic 2); `eqTable r : ETable n` holds `eq(r, ·)` on the cube. |
| Sumcheck messages | A round polynomial travels as its coefficient list, low degree first, of length `d + 1`; the oracle protocol sends all of them. Dropping one is the *encoding* of Layer 12 (`transcript.rs:289-309`), inverted by the running claim. |
| Statements and parameters | The program `prog`, the announced `sizes` and the public `input` are Lean parameters of every phase; a phase's `StmtIn` carries only what earlier phases produced (challenges, claims). The relation of the first phase is `{(input, w) \| SatisfiedBy prog input w ∧ Sizes.ofWitness w = sizes}`. |
| The oracle | One committed oracle `q : Column μ_stack` for the whole protocol (`OStmt : Unit → Type`), with `OracleInterface` query `Vector E μ_stack` and answer `eval₂Mle q`. No other oracle exists in the oracle protocol; WHIR's codewords appear only in Layer 11. |
| Errors | `ℝ≥0`, per verifier message, as ArkLib's `rbrKnowledgeError`; the closed form is a `def` next to the theorem, and the interactive error is its sum. `|E|` is `Fintype.card E`, rewritten to `2^192` only in the numeric acceptance test. |
| Bus | Width `m = 16`; coordinate 0 is the separator `g^0 / g^1 / g^2` for state, memory, bytecode; coordinates follow the specification's tuple order; unused coordinates are the constant `0`. Fingerprint `π_α(t) = Σ_{i<16} eq(α, bits i) · t_i` with `α : Fin 4 → E`; leaf `β − π_α(t)`, padding leaf `1`. |
| Count tree | Leaves are the tables' count columns themselves (`α = 0`, no `β`), padded with `1` to the bus trees' depth; the finalize counts are not in it (`layout.rs:412`). |
| GKR | Radix 4 from the root down; if `μ` is odd, one radix-2 layer first. A fresh combiner `λ` per layer; two combination challenges after each radix-4 layer; the three trees share every challenge and end at one `ζ`. Layer sumcheck messages have degree 5 (eq × four multilinears); the round check is on the cofactor (Gruen). |
| Stacks | Blocks ordered largest first at aligned offsets; `sel_b = offset_b >> κ_b`; `q̃(z, sel_b) = P̃_b(z)`. The witness stack holds every table column in table order, then `mem_0, mem_1, mem_2`, `cntfin_mem`, `cntfin_bc`, `q_flock` (`witness.rs:85-101`); `μ_stack ∈ [15, 28]`. |
| Table sumcheck | Variables bound highest first; table `j` joins at round `τ_max − τ_j`; its summand is padded by `∏_{k ≥ τ_j} X_k`; round polynomials have degree 3; `ξ` powers: constraints table by table, then the three bus sides in `[push, pull, count]` order sharing the last three powers; the target is computed by the verifier, never sent (finding F4). |
| Claim pool order | Bus (framework block) claims, then per-table column claims, then the three public-input limb claims (`finish_claims`, `cpu/mod.rs:656-667`); ring-switched claims take the low powers of `λ`, point claims the high ones (finding F8). |
| Fiat–Shamir | A Merkle–Damgård chain of `compress` on a 256-bit state; block lane 3 carries the tag `1` (observe), `2` (squeeze), `3` (grinding base), `4` (grinding nonce); no labels (finding F1); seeded by `compress(iv, input)` with `iv` the BLAKE2s of `"leanvm" ‖ len ‖ R1CS_DIGEST ‖ bytecodeHash`; one squeeze yields one `E` challenge (three low words). |
| Verifier shape | `verify` is a total, computable function of `(prog, input, proof)` to `Bool`; it never panics; a malformed proof is `false`. Structure checks on public data that the Rust `assert!`s (finding F10) are theorems about the layout, not branches of `verify`. |
| Trusted surface | Every trusted definition fits on one screen, cites its source line, and appears in [Interfaces](#interfaces-supplied-to-later-work); assumed interfaces are structures with a docstring naming the upstream witness obligation, never `variable`-block hypotheses or `axiom`s. |
| Unproved targets | A statement whose dependency is not yet available is a block comment at its place, carrying the statement and the dependency (leanISA convention). Never `sorry`. |
| Generic code | A generic definition or theorem lives under `LeanerVM/Protocol/Generic/` with a module docstring naming the ArkLib issue; when the upstream pull request merges and the pin moves, the local copy is deleted in the same pull request. |
| Module system | ArkLib is a `module` library; a file importing ArkLib and not Clean (nor a plain file) is a `module`. The Clean bridge (Layer 2), the M3 instance (Layer 3) and every file above them that consumes the relation are plain. |

## The build, in fourteen layers

Every layer names what to define and what to prove, intrinsically. Each layer's tests are part
of the layer. Layers are landed only fully proved.

### Layer 0: the ArkLib dependency and the field instances

`lakefile.toml`, `upstreams.json`, `docs/dependencies.md`; `LeanerVM/Protocol/Field.lean`.

Add ArkLib at `dca90385` as the `Arklib` requirement (its package name). ArkLib requires CompPoly
at the `v4.33.1` tag; the root pin `3468b38c` wins the resolution, and ArkLib's
`ToCompPoly` modules build against it. Supply what ArkLib needs of the fields:

```lean
instance : SampleableType K          -- a uniform `Fin (2^64)` read as a bit pattern
instance : SampleableType E          -- three independent limbs through `Ext.ofVector`; never enumerates
theorem card_E : Fintype.card E = 2 ^ 192   -- CompPoly `card_ext3`, the one cardinality fact
/-- The stacked columns as an oracle: a query is a point of `E^n`, the answer `q̃` there. -/
instance evalOracle (n : ℕ) : OracleInterface (Column n) where
  Query := Vector E n
  ...  -- answer := eval₂Mle q (algebraMap K E)
theorem evalOracle_answer (q : Column n) (r : Vector E n) :
    OracleInterface.answer q r = CMlPolynomialEval.eval₂Mle q.values (algebraMap K E) r
```

The sampler is the point at which a wrong `Fintype` would enumerate `2^64` or `2^192` elements
(finding P3); it is `SampleableType.ofEquiv` on the carrier views, as ArkLib's own
`KoalaBear.Ext6.sampleableType`, and a test probes that it has compiler IR. Points are CompPoly's
`Vector E n`; ArkLib's `Fin n → E` is `Vector.ofFn` away. Tests: `#guard`s that the oracle
answers `evalMle` on a two-variable table, on and off the cube, with a mutated column;
`example : Fintype.card E = 2 ^ 192 := card_E`.

### Layer 1: hypercube tables, stacking, the index and bytecode columns

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Multilinear.lean` and `LeanerVM/Protocol/Stacking.lean` (generic),
`LeanerVM/Protocol/Stack.lean` (leanVM).

```lean
structure Column (n : ℕ) where values : CMlPolynomialEval K n     -- Layer 0; not an abbreviation
abbrev ETable (n : ℕ) := CMlPolynomialEval E n
def sumCube (t : ETable n) : E                                  -- Σ over the cube
def ETable.mul (s t : ETable n) : ETable n                     -- pointwise
def eqTable (r : Fin n → E) : ETable n                         -- values of eq(r, ·)
theorem eval_eq_sum_eqTable (t : ETable n) (r) : evalMle t r = sumCube (eqTable r).mul t
theorem sumCube_prod_vars : sumCube (∏ X_k) = 1                -- Σ_x x_0 ⋯ x_{n-1} = 1

structure Block where (κ : ℕ) (values : Column κ)
def stack (blocks : List Block) : (μ : ℕ) × Column μ           -- largest first, aligned, 0-pad
def selector (blocks) (b : Fin blocks.length) : Fin (μ - κ_b) → E   -- the bits of offset_b >> κ_b
theorem stack_eval (b) (z : Fin κ_b → E) :
    evalMle (stack blocks).2 (z ++ selector blocks b) = evalMle blocks[b].values z
theorem stack_eval_pad (ζ) : evalMle (stack …).2 ζ = Σ_b eq(sel_b, ζ_hi) · P̃_b(ζ_lo) + pad(ζ)

def idxColumn (κ : ℕ) : Column κ                               -- g^i at index i
theorem idxColumn_eval (ζ : Fin κ → E) :
    evalMle (idxColumn κ) ζ = ∏ k, (1 + ζ k * (1 + ofK (g ^ (2 ^ k.val))))     -- §6.5
def bytecodeColumn (prog : Program) : Column (prog.logSize + 4)   -- slot s of instruction z
theorem bytecodeColumn_slot (z s) : (bytecodeColumn prog)[z + 2^k_bc * s] = (encodeSlots (prog.code z))[s]
```

`stack_eval` is the one selector fact every later decomposition uses; `stack_eval_pad` is
specification (5.4) with `pad(ζ) = 1 + Σ_b eq(sel_b, ζ_hi)` when the padding value is `1` (a
second version pads with `0` for the witness stack). Generic parts are ArkLib's `Data/MvPolynomial`
candidates. Tests: `stack_eval` decided in the kernel on three blocks of sizes 4, 2, 1;
`idxColumn_eval` at `κ = 2`; `bytecodeColumn_slot` on a two-instruction program.

### Layer 2: Clean components as polynomials

`LeanerVM/Arithmetization/M3.lean` (plain; generic over any `Ensemble`).

```lean
def Expression.toMvPolynomial : Expression F → MvPolynomial ℕ F     -- var i ↦ X i
theorem eval_toMvPolynomial (env : Environment F) (e) :
    MvPolynomial.eval env.get e.toMvPolynomial = e.eval env
def Expression.degreeBound : Expression F → ℕ                      -- syntactic; add max, mul sum
theorem totalDegree_le_degreeBound (e) : e.toMvPolynomial.totalDegree ≤ e.degreeBound

structure M3Table (F) where
  width : ℕ
  constraints : List (MvPolynomial (Fin width) F)
  flushes : List (Direction × Vector (MvPolynomial (Fin width) F) 16)   -- separator first
  count : List (Fin width)                                             -- the count columns
def Component.toM3 (c : Component F) (sep : RawChannel F → F) (dir : RawChannel F → Direction) :
    M3Table F
theorem toM3_constraints_iff (t : Table F) (row ∈ t.table) :
    (∀ C ∈ (t.component.toM3 …).constraints, eval row C = 0) ↔ t.component.operations.ConstraintsHold (t.environment row)
theorem toM3_flushes_eq (t : Table F) : (multiset of evaluated flush tuples) = (multiset of `t.interactions` mapped to 16-tuples)
```

The direction and separator are given per channel, so the mapping from Clean's typed channels to
the M3 bus is explicit data. `toM3_constraints_iff` is the bridge that turns the zerocheck into
`w.Constraints`; `toM3_flushes_eq` turns bus balance into `BalancedPair`. Out-of-range variables
are excluded by `width`; a component whose expressions mention a variable at or beyond
`circuit.size` has no `M3Table` (a theorem `vars_lt_width` per table). Upstream candidate: Clean
(`Expression.toMvPolynomial`, `degreeBound`). Tests: a two-column example component whose
constraint `x * y` has `degreeBound = 2`, and whose `toM3_constraints_iff` is checked on a
satisfying and a failing row.

### Layer 3: the M3 instance of leanISA

`LeanerVM/Protocol/M3.lean` (plain). Needs leanISA Layers 5–8.

```lean
structure Sizes where
  logMem : ℕ
  τ : Fin 6 → ℕ
  logInvRate : ℕ                                   -- WHIR rate exponent, announced with the sizes
def Sizes.ofWitness (w : EnsembleWitness leanIsaEnsemble) : Option Sizes   -- `none` unless every height is 2^τ
def Sizes.Admissible (prog : Program) (s : Sizes) : Prop      -- the caps; decidable
theorem admissible_iff_caps : s.Admissible prog ↔ (Caps w ∧ Sizes.ofWitness w = some s)

def leanIsaTables : Fin 6 → M3Table K       -- `Component.toM3` of the six tables with leanISA's separators
theorem leanIsaTables_degree (j) (C ∈ (leanIsaTables j).constraints) : C.totalDegree ≤ 2
theorem leanIsaTables_flush_degree …  ≤ 2

structure StackLayout (prog) (s : Sizes) where …    -- offsets and selectors of every column, mem, cntfin, q_flock
def StackLayout.μ : ℕ
structure LeafLayout (prog) (s : Sizes) where …     -- push, pull and count blocks with their selectors
def stackOf (w : M3Witness prog s) : Column (StackLayout.μ)
def columnOf (q : Column μ) (c : ColumnId) : Column (κ c)           -- reading a column back

/-- The polynomial statement the oracle protocol establishes about a stack. -/
def M3Holds (prog) (input) (s : Sizes) (q : Column μ) : Prop :=
  (∀ j C x, eval (row of q at x) C = 0) ∧ busBalanced q ∧ countsNonzero q ∧
  s.Admissible prog ∧ (mem columns at 0, 1) = (input.word0, input.word1) ∧ Blake2sRows q

def witnessOf (prog) (s) (q : Column μ) : EnsembleWitness leanIsaEnsemble
theorem satisfiedBy_witnessOf (h : M3Holds prog input s q) : SatisfiedBy prog input (witnessOf prog s q)
theorem m3Holds_stackOf (h : SatisfiedBy prog input w) (hs : Sizes.ofWitness w = some s) :
    M3Holds prog input s (stackOf w)
theorem witnessOf_stackOf (hs) : witnessOf prog s (stackOf w) = w    -- on the committed fields
```

`M3Holds` is the target of extraction and the source of completeness; the two theorems around it
are the whole bridge between polynomials and Clean's witness. `witnessOf` rebuilds the tables from
the columns, the interactions from the components, the image from the memory columns, and the
program from `prog`; `Blake2sRows` is the leanISA `Blake2sRelation` on the BLAKE2S rows, whose
eighteen value limbs are read from `q_flock` through the Flock interface (Layer 9). The stack
layout transcribes `witness.rs:85-101` and `leaf.rs:53-156`; every offset is a `decide`. Tests: a
witness with one row per table stacked and read back (`witnessOf_stackOf` by `decide +kernel` on
the columns); `Sizes.Admissible` rejects `logMem = 15` and `τ_BLAKE2S = 2`.

### Layer 4: sumcheck for eq-weighted virtual polynomials

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Generic/Sumcheck.lean` (module; ArkLib upstream, ledger A1).

leanVM runs sumcheck on polynomials the verifier cannot evaluate at the end: the summand is a
formula in the columns' extensions, so the last step is "the prover sends the column values at
`r`, the verifier evaluates the formula, and the values become claims". Define, over a field `F`
with `[Fintype F] [SampleableType F]`:

```lean
/-- A virtual polynomial: `n` variables, a list of `m` oracle tables, and a formula of degree `d`. -/
structure Virtual (F) (n m d : ℕ) where
  formula : (Fin m → F) → F            -- a polynomial of total degree ≤ d in its m inputs
  formula_poly : ∃ p : MvPolynomial (Fin m) F, p.totalDegree ≤ d ∧ ∀ v, formula v = eval v p
def Virtual.eval (V) (tables : Fin m → ETable n) (x : Fin n → F) : F := V.formula (fun i ↦ evalMle (tables i) x)

def sumcheck (V : Virtual F n m d) : OracleReduction []ₒ
    (StmtIn := F)                       -- the claimed sum
    (OStmtIn := fun _ : Fin m ↦ ETable n) Unit
    (StmtOut := (Fin n → F) × (Fin m → F))   -- the point and the claimed table values
    (OStmtOut := fun _ : Fin m ↦ ETable n) Unit
    (pSpec := round schedule: n × (P_to_V : Fin (d + 1) → F ; V_to_P : F), then P_to_V : Fin m → F)
def sumcheck.relIn : Set ((F × (Fin m → ETable n)) × Unit) := {⟨⟨T, t⟩, _⟩ | Σ_x V.eval t x = T}
def sumcheck.relOut := {⟨⟨(r, v), t⟩, _⟩ | ∀ i, evalMle (t i) r = v i ∧ V.formula v = (final running claim)}
theorem sumcheck_perfectCompleteness : (sumcheck V).perfectCompleteness init impl relIn relOut
theorem sumcheck_rbrKnowledgeSoundness :
    (sumcheck V).verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundnessWorstCase init impl relIn relOut (fun _ ↦ d / |F|)
```

with the *eq-weighted, back-loaded* variant built on it: tables of different heights `τ_j ≤ n`
lifted to `n` variables by `∏_{k ≥ τ_j} X_k` with `sumCube_prod_vars`, the verifier's running
weight `∏ (challenges of the rounds a table sat out)`, and `eq(ζ_{<τ_j}, ·)` as an explicit
factor whose evaluation at `r` the verifier computes itself (so `d` counts the cofactor plus one).
Add the batching component:

```lean
/-- Random linear combination of `k` claims by the powers of one challenge. -/
def batchClaims (k : ℕ) : OracleReduction … (StmtIn := Fin k → claim) (StmtOut := F × claim) …
theorem batchClaims_rbrKnowledgeSoundness : … (fun _ ↦ (k - 1) / |F|)
```

Its invariant is "some claim is false"; escape needs the batching polynomial, of degree `< k`, to
vanish at the challenge. Tests: `sumcheck` on a two-variable degree-2 virtual polynomial, honest
run accepted by `#guard`, a wrong round polynomial rejected.

### Layer 5: fingerprints, the grand product, and GKR

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Generic/GrandProduct.lean` (module; ArkLib upstream, ledger A6).

```lean
def fingerprint (α : Fin 4 → E) (t : Vector K 16) : E := Σ i, eqTilde α (bits i) * ofK t[i]
def sideProduct (α β) (P : Multiset (Vector K 16)) : E := (P.map fun t ↦ β - fingerprint α t).prod
/-- Specification Lemma 5.2: the product polynomial determines the multiset. -/
theorem sideProduct_poly_eq_iff (P Q : Multiset (Vector K 16)) :
    (Π_P : MvPolynomial (Fin 5) K) = Π_Q ↔ P = Q
/-- Specification Theorem 5.1: unequal multisets of size ≤ 2^μ collide at (α, β) with probability ≤ 4·2^μ/|E|. -/
theorem sideProduct_collision (hne : P ≠ Q) (hμ) :
    Pr[α β ← uniform; sideProduct α β P = sideProduct α β Q] ≤ 4 * 2 ^ μ / |E|

structure ProductTree (μ : ℕ) where leaves : ETable μ            -- layers are derived
def ProductTree.root : E
def gkr (nside μ : ℕ) : OracleReduction []ₒ
    (StmtIn := Fin nside → E)                                    -- the claimed roots
    (OStmtIn := fun _ : Fin nside ↦ ETable μ) Unit               -- the leaf tables
    (StmtOut := (Fin μ → E) × (Fin nside → E))                   -- ζ and the leaf claims Ṽ₀ˢ(ζ)
    (OStmtOut := fun _ : Fin nside ↦ ETable μ) Unit …
theorem gkr_perfectCompleteness : (gkr nside μ).perfectCompleteness …
theorem gkr_rbrKnowledgeSoundness :
    (gkr nside μ).verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundnessWorstCase … (gkrError nside μ)
```

`gkr` is radix 4 with the odd first layer, a fresh `λ` per layer, and the two combination
challenges per layer, exactly as pinned; `gkrError` assigns `(nside − 1)/|E|` to each `λ`, `5/|E|`
to each sumcheck round and `2/|E|` to each combination pair. Lemma 5.2 is proved by unique
factorization in `K[A_0, …, A_3, X]`: the factors `X − π_A(t)` are monic linear, hence
irreducible, and two products of irreducibles agree only up to associates, which for monic
factors is equality; the specification leaves this proof `TODO` (finding S9). Tests: `gkr 1 2`
and `gkr 3 3` honest runs accepted; a leaf changed after the root is sent rejected;
`sideProduct_poly_eq_iff` refuted on `{t} ≠ {t, t}` by `decide` at `μ = 1`.

### Layer 6: the bus phase

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Bus.lean` (plain). Needs Layers 1, 3, 5.

```lean
def pushLeaves pullLeaves countLeaves (L : LeafLayout prog s) (α β) (q : Column μ) : ETable μ_bus
def busPhase (prog) (s) : OracleReduction []ₒ
    (StmtIn := Unit) (OStmtIn := fun _ : Unit ↦ Column μ) Unit
    (StmtOut := BusOut) (OStmtOut := fun _ : Unit ↦ Column μ) Unit
    (pSpec := V_to_P : (Fin 4 → E) × E ; P_to_V : E × E ; gkr 3 μ_bus's rounds ; P_to_V : boundary evaluations)
structure BusOut where
  ζ : Fin μ_bus → E
  rem : Fin 3 → E                         -- what the tables owe per side (§5.4 "Settling it")
  pool : List Claim                      -- boundary-block column claims at ζ_lo
  α : Fin 4 → E ; β : E
def busPhase.relOut : Set (…) :=
  {…| (∀ j, Σ_x eq(ζ_{<τ_j}, x) · B_j^s(x) = rem s) ∧ every pooled claim holds for q ∧ (count root ≠ 0)}
/-- Specification (5.4): the leaf extension splits into public selectors, block extensions and padding. -/
theorem leaf_decomposition (L) (ζ) : evalMle (pushLeaves L α β q) ζ = Σ_b eq(sel_b, ζ_hi) · (β − Σ_i eq(α, i) · c̃_{b,i}(ζ_lo)) + pad ζ
theorem busPhase_perfectCompleteness …
theorem busPhase_rbrKnowledgeSoundness : … (busError s)
```

The verifier checks `R_c ≠ 0`; the push and pull roots are one message (finding F3), so their
equality is structural. `busError` is `4·2^μ_bus/|E|` on the `(α, β)` message plus
`gkrError 3 μ_bus`. The knowledge state function's invariant after `(α, β)` is "the pushed and
pulled multisets of `q` differ, or some count is zero, or a boundary claim is false"; the proof
that acceptance under a true invariant is a GKR escape is `sideProduct_collision` plus Layer 5.
Tests: `leaf_decomposition` in the kernel on a layout with two blocks; the whole phase run on
the Layer 3 one-row witness.

### Layer 7: the table sumcheck phase

`LeanerVM/Protocol/TableSumcheck.lean` (plain). Needs Layers 3, 4, 6.

```lean
def tableSummand (prog) (s) (ζ) (ξ : E) (α β) (rem) : Virtual E τ_max (Σ_j width_j) 3   -- the F of §5.5
def tableSumcheck (prog) (s) : OracleReduction []ₒ (StmtIn := BusOut) … (StmtOut := BusOut × ColumnClaims) …
    (pSpec := V_to_P : E ; the sumcheck's rounds ; P_to_V : Fin (Σ width) → E)
theorem tableSummand_target : Σ_x tableSummand … x = Σ_s ξ^(B + s) · rem s    -- the verifier's target
theorem tableSumcheck_relOut_implies_constraints (h : relOut …) :
    (∀ j C, C̃_j(ζ_{<τ_j}) = 0 → …) -- see below
theorem tableSumcheck_perfectCompleteness …
theorem tableSumcheck_rbrKnowledgeSoundness : … ((B + 2)/|E| on ξ, 3/|E| per round)
```

The output relation says every column claim is a true evaluation of `q`'s column and the
formula reproduces the final value; the knowledge state function's invariant after `ξ` is "some
constraint extension `C̃_{j,i}(ζ_{<τ_j})` is nonzero or some bus form disagrees with `rem`".
Turning "every `C̃_{j,i}(ζ_{<τ_j}) = 0`" into "every constraint vanishes on the cube" is the
zerocheck argument with `ζ` sampled after the commitment (§5.5 "point recycling"): it is charged
to the `(α, β)` and GKR challenges of Layer 6, where `ζ` is drawn, as an extra `τ_max/|E|` per
constraint by `MLE_eq_zero_iff` and Schwartz–Zippel. Tests: `tableSummand_target` on two tables
of heights 2 and 1; a row violating a JUMP identity makes the honest run's final check fail.

### Layer 8: the public-input phase

`LeanerVM/Protocol/PublicInput.lean` (plain). Needs Layer 3.

```lean
def publicInputPhase (prog) (s) (input) : OracleReduction []ₒ … (pSpec := V_to_P : E ; P_to_V : E × E)
theorem publicInputPhase_rbrKnowledgeSoundness : … (fun _ ↦ 2 / |E|)
```

The verifier forms `(1 + r_m)·word_ℓ + r_m·word'_ℓ` for the two limbs and pools three claims on
`mem_0, mem_1, mem_2` at `(r_m, 0, …, 0)`, the third with value `0` (acceptance test 10). Tests:
a wrong `c_0` rejected.

### Layer 9: the Flock and ring-switching boundary

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Flock.lean` (plain). Needs Layer 3 and #3.

```lean
/-- What the Flock roadmap supplies. Every field is a declaration of #3; this structure only names them. -/
structure FlockInterface (prog) (s) where
  reduction : OracleReduction []ₒ (StmtIn := ColumnClaims) (OStmtIn := fun _ : Unit ↦ Column μ) Unit
      (StmtOut := WeightedClaim) (OStmtOut := fun _ : Unit ↦ Column μ) Unit pSpecFlock
  limbColumns : Column μ → Fin 18 → Column (s.τ 5)      -- the BLAKE2S value limbs read from q_flock
  relIn : Set _   -- the eighteen column claims are true of `limbColumns` and the rows are valid compressions
  relOut : Set _  -- the weighted claim holds for q
  perfectCompleteness : reduction.perfectCompleteness …
  rbrKnowledgeSoundness : reduction.verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundnessWorstCase … flockError
  flockError_le : Σ flockError ≤ (4 * k_batch + 163) / |E| + 2 ^ 32 / |E|
```

The weighted claim is `⟨W, q⟩ = c` with `W` MLE-friendly (Definition 3.12): a `Weight μ` is a
function evaluating `W̃` at any point together with its cube values and their agreement. This
is an assumed interface in the sense of the authoring skill: it names a real external boundary,
its witness obligation is #3's F3–F5 and F8, and nothing here unfolds it. Until #3 supplies it,
Layer 10 takes a `FlockInterface` as a parameter and the theorems say so in their signatures.
Tests: none beyond typechecking; the instance's tests belong to #3.

### Layer 10: the claim pool, the opening sumcheck, and the oracle protocol

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Piop.lean` (plain). Needs Layers 6–9.

```lean
structure Weight (μ) where (onCube : ETable μ) (mle : (Fin μ → E) → E) (mle_eq : ∀ r, mle r = evalMle onCube r)
structure WeightedClaim (μ) where (W : Weight μ) (c : E)
def Claim.toWeighted (L : StackLayout prog s) : Claim → WeightedClaim μ     -- eq((ζ, sel), ·) or strided
def openingPhase (μ) (J : ℕ) : OracleReduction []ₒ (StmtIn := Fin J → WeightedClaim μ) … (StmtOut := Unit) …
    (pSpec := V_to_P : E ; sumcheck (W_λ · q) rounds ; the final evaluation query)
theorem openingPhase_rbrKnowledgeSoundness : … ((J − 1)/|E| on λ, 2/|E| per round)

def leanVmPiop (prog) (s) (input) (flock : FlockInterface prog s) : OracleReduction []ₒ
    (StmtIn := PublicInput) (OStmtIn := fun _ : Empty ↦ Unit) (M3Witness prog s)
    (StmtOut := Unit) (OStmtOut := fun _ : Empty ↦ Unit) Unit (pSpec := …) :=
  commitPhase ⟫ busPhase ⟫ tableSumcheck ⟫ publicInputPhase ⟫ flock.reduction ⟫ openingPhase
def leanVmVerifier … : OracleVerifier …  := (leanVmPiop …).verifier
def leanVmProver … : OracleProver … := (leanVmPiop …).prover
def piopError (s : Sizes) : (pSpec …).ChallengeIdx → ℝ≥0

theorem piop_perfectCompleteness (hs : s.Admissible prog) :
    (leanVmPiop prog s input flock).perfectCompleteness init impl
      (m3Relation prog s) Set.univ
theorem piop_rbrKnowledgeSoundness (hs : s.Admissible prog) :

      (m3Relation prog s) Set.univ (piopError s)
theorem piopError_le (hs : s.Admissible prog) : Σ i, piopError s i ≤ 2 ^ 40 / |E| + flockError
```

`commitPhase` sends `q` as the one oracle message; its output relation is `M3Holds`, and the
extractor of the whole protocol is `witnessOf` applied to that message: straight-line, reading
the oracle. `⟫` is `OracleReduction.append`; the composition theorems are ArkLib's for
completeness and Layer 10's own contribution for round-by-round knowledge soundness of an
append with a pure first verifier (ledger A2), proved once generically here and upstreamed.
`Set.univ` as the output relation says the last phase leaves nothing to check. The honest prover
is computable: each phase's prover is a function of `w`, the challenges so far and the layer
tables. Tests: the whole protocol on the Layer 3 witness with #3's toy Flock instance (or, until
it exists, with the phases up to Layer 8 composed), honest run accepted by `#guard`; the
knowledge extractor recovers the witness; `piopError_le` by `norm_num` at the caps.

### Layer 11: WHIR over binary Reed–Solomon codes, and Merkle trees

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Generic/Whir.lean` (module; ArkLib upstream, ledger A7; shared with #3 F6),
`LeanerVM/Parameters/Whir.lean`, `LeanerVM/Parameters/Blake2sHash.lean`,
`LeanerVM/Protocol/Pcs.lean`.

```lean

def merkleRoot : List (Vector K leafWords) → Digest
def merkleVerify : Digest → ℕ → Vector K leafWords → Path → Bool
```

`whirOpen` is stated exactly as Protocol B.1: batch, `ℓ_i` sumcheck rounds, commit, one
out-of-domain sample from level 1 on (`ood_samples[0] = 0`), `t_i` queries, and the final
plaintext level. Its soundness is *round-by-round soundness for the list relation* `relopen`, not
knowledge soundness: the commitment is list binding (Definition B.1), and the theorem is stated
on the invariant "every codeword within `γ_i` of the current fold violates the current claim".
Layer 12 turns list binding into extraction of the one `q` that satisfies every pooled claim.
Tests: `encode` against CompPoly's additive NTT at `κ = 3`; `merkleVerify` on a four-leaf tree
with a wrong sibling rejected; the honest `whirOpen` at toy parameters (`μ = 4`, rate `1/2`)
accepted; the parameter tables against `verifier.py:910`.

### Layer 12: compilation, the transcript, the proof, and the executable verifier

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Transcript.lean`, `LeanerVM/Protocol/Proof.lean`,
`LeanerVM/Protocol/Verify.lean` (plain).

```lean
-- Fiat–Shamir chain (Category B, fiat_shamir/src/lib.rs)

    verify prog input proof = true ↔
      ∃ s, s.Admissible prog ∧ (Verifier.fiatShamir (leanVmIopp prog s input flock).verifier …)

/-- Assumed interfaces, each an ArkLib theorem to come (ledger A5). -/

theorem verify_knowledgeSound (fs : FiatShamirSecurity) (bcs : BcsSecurity) (mca : McaJohnson) (flock) :

```

`verify` is one function, phase by phase in the stream order of the conventions, total and
computable, and is the first module whose code-generation probe is a test. `verify_iff_compiled`
is the refinement theorem and is unconditional: it is about two definitions. The non-interactive
theorem is stated with the three interfaces as explicit arguments, so the reader sees exactly
what is assumed; `niError` is the round-by-round maximum times the query bound plus the
grinding-adjusted WHIR terms. The bytecode multilinear and the Flock matrices are evaluated
natively inside `verify` through one function `settleFixedClaims`, the seam for T5. Tests: a
proof dumped from the pinned Rust prover (`scripts/dump-proof.sh`, recorded with its program and
public input) accepted by `verify` under `#guard`; each of six mutations (a flipped stream
scalar in each phase, a wrong Merkle sibling) rejected; `RoundPoly.decode` on the Rust's
encoding.

### Layer 13: T4 and the fixtures

`LeanerVM/Protocol/Soundness.lean` (plain). Needs Layer 12 and leanISA Layer 10.

```lean
theorem baseVerifier_extractsExecution (fs bcs mca flock) (h : verify prog input proof = true) :
    except with probability niError, ∃ t, ValidExecution prog input t
theorem baseProver_complete (hfill : HasFillBlocks prog) (h : ValidExecution prog input t) :
    verify prog input (prove prog input (witness of t)) = true
```

The first composes `verify_knowledgeSound`, `satisfiedBy_witnessOf` and `constraintSoundness`;
the second composes `constraintCompleteness`, `m3Holds_stackOf`, `piop_perfectCompleteness` and
the determinism of the Fiat–Shamir chain (perfect completeness survives the transform without
any assumption). Both are the T4 statements of [architecture.md](../architecture.md), the
first conditional exactly as the ledger says. Tests: the differential fixture of Layer 12,
re-stated as an instance of `baseVerifier_extractsExecution`'s hypothesis.

## Acceptance tests and nearby false statements

Each names a reading that compiles and is wrong, and the witness that rejects it. Where the
witness is executable it is a test under `tests/`.

1. **Fingerprint degree.** `π_α` is multilinear in `α : E^4`, so a leaf has total degree 4 in
   `(α, β)` and Theorem 5.1's error is `4·2^μ/|E|`, not `2^μ/|E|`. `sideProduct_collision`
   carries the 4; a version with 1 is unprovable.
2. **Padding leaves are 1.** A `0` pad zeroes every product, and a `0` pad in the count tree
   makes `R_c = 0` reject honest proofs. `pushLeaves` pads with `1`; the witness stack pads
   with `0`. Witness: the honest run of Layer 6 on a one-row witness (whose trees are padded).
3. **`R_c ≠ 0` is load-bearing.** A read at an invalid address with count `0` pulls `(a, 0, v)`
   and pushes `(a, g·0, v) = (a, 0, v)`: balanced. Witness: the Layer 6 mutation with a zero
   count is accepted by a verifier that skips the check and rejected by `busPhase`.
4. **One root, not two.** The push and pull roots are one stream scalar (finding F3). A `Proof`
   with two roots and an equality check would have a different stream layout and reject every
   Rust proof. `verify_iff_compiled` pins the shape.
5. **Domain separators.** Without coordinate 0, a memory tuple `(a, c, v, 0…)` and a bytecode
   tuple with the same eight low coordinates coincide. Witness: two tuples equal after dropping
   coordinate 0, distinguished by `leanIsaTables` flush polynomials.
6. **Zerocheck point recycling.** `ζ` is drawn after `q` is committed. A version with `ζ` drawn
   before the commitment is unsound: commit a column vanishing at `ζ_{<τ}` only. The state
   function of Layer 7 charges the zerocheck to Layer 6's challenges.
7. **Back-loaded padding.** Lifting table `j` by `∏_{k ≥ τ_j} X_k` sums to the table's own sum
   (`sumCube_prod_vars`). Lifting by nothing multiplies it by `2^(τ_max − τ_j)`. Witness:
   `tableSummand_target` on heights 2 and 1.
8. **Degree three, three scalars.** The table round polynomial is cubic; the wire carries three
   coefficients and `decode` reconstructs `c_1`. A quadratic reading rejects every Rust proof
   (finding F6). Witness: `RoundPoly.decode` on the dumped proof.
9. **Shared bus powers.** The three bus forms share the last three `ξ` powers across tables
   (finding F5); per-table powers make the target not factor through `rem_s`. Witness:
   `tableSummand_target` fails with per-table powers on two tables.
10. **Top limb of the public input.** The claim `mem_2(r_m, 0…) = 0` is pooled although no
    scalar is sent for it; omitting it lets a non-canonical public word pass the line. Witness:
    the Layer 8 mutation with a nonzero `mem_2` at cell 0 and the third claim dropped.
11. **Joint list binding.** WHIR is list binding, not binding; the extractor needs *one* member
    of the list to satisfy *all* pooled claims. Per-claim soundness ("each claim holds for some
    nearby codeword") does not compose to a witness. The invariant of `whirOpen_rbrSoundness` is
    joint by construction; `verify_knowledgeSound` extracts the member.
12. **Absorb before squeeze.** The sizes and the commitment root are observed before `α`;
    every claim value is observed before `λ`. A chain sampling `α` before the root is broken.
    `FsState` follows the stream order; `verify_iff_compiled` fails otherwise.
13. **Index column bit order.** `∏ (1 + ζ_k (1 + g^(2^k)))` reads bit `k` as coordinate `k`;
    high-first order evaluates a different column. Witness: `idxColumn_eval` at `κ = 2` by
    `decide +kernel`.
14. **Bytecode slot bits.** The opcode is `P(z, 1, 1, 0, 0)`: slot 3 in low-first bits.
    Witness: `bytecodeColumn_slot` on a two-instruction program.
15. **Selector alignment.** Blocks sit at offsets that are multiples of their size, largest
    first; `stack_eval` fails for any other placement. Witness: three blocks of sizes 4, 2, 1
    with the small one first.
16. **Variable order.** Sumcheck binds the highest variable first; table `j` joins at round
    `τ_max − τ_j`. Reversing it mismatches `eq(ζ_{<τ_j}, ·)`. Witness: the honest run of Layer 7
    with two heights.
17. **Radix and parity.** For odd `μ` the root layer is radix 2 and the rest radix 4; a
    uniformly radix-2 GKR has a different message count. `verify_iff_compiled` on the dumped
    proof (whose `μ_bus` is recorded) is the test.
18. **Counts in the count tree.** The tables' count columns only, not the finalize counts
    (`layout.rs:412`); the spec's "nothing checks the finalize counts" holds either way, but the
    leaf layout, and so `ζ`, differ. Witness: the dumped proof.
19. **The extractor reads the stack.** The witness is `witnessOf` of the committed `q`, not of
    the openings or the roots; a "witness" built from the transcript alone is not an
    `EnsembleWitness`. `witnessOf_stackOf` pins it.
20. **Perfect completeness needs no exceptional-challenge clause** in Layers 4–8 and 10: no
    inverse of a challenge is taken. Flock's `(1 + r_eq)⁻¹` at `r_eq = 1` is #3's, inside
    `flockError`. Witness: `piop_perfectCompleteness` has no side condition on challenges.
21. **Sizes are parameters.** The verifier reads `sizes` from the stream and dispatches; the
    oracle protocol is a family indexed by them. A version that puts `sizes` in the oracle
    message type cannot state `OracleInterface`. `verify_iff_compiled` quantifies `∃ s`.
22. **Tags, not labels.** The chain has four numeric tags and no per-challenge labels
    (finding F1); a labelled transcript rejects every Rust proof. Witness: the dumped proof.
23. **Numeric error.** `piopError_le`: at the caps, `Σ piopError < 2^{-150}` plus Flock's
    `< 2^{-183}`; a reading that bounds each term by `1/|E|` and forgets `2^μ` is off by `2^40`.

## Interfaces supplied to later work

These names are the public boundary and the reviewer's reading list. The recursion work (T5,
T6), the Flock roadmap, and the ArkLib upstream pull requests consume them.

Everything not listed is a proof, a helper, or a test. The assumed interfaces a reviewer must
know are exactly: `FlockInterface` (#3), `McaJohnson` (ArkLib, ledger A8), `FiatShamirSecurity`
and `BcsSecurity` (ArkLib, ledger A5). Each is a structure whose fields are the statements of
theorems another roadmap owes; none is an axiom, and every theorem that uses one takes it as an
argument. There are no `variable`-block hypotheses.

## Boundaries

**With the leanISA roadmap (#4).** Two requests, filed as `[Roadmap]: leanISA` issues:
`Caps` should require every table height to be a power of two and the bytecode length `2^k_bc`,
since the verifier accepts only log-heights (`cpu/mod.rs:158-170`) and `constraintCompleteness`
already pads; and Layer 5's channels should record, per channel, the domain separator and the
coordinate order of the 16-slot bus tuple (`Component.toM3`'s `sep`/`dir` arguments), so that
the bus of this roadmap is a transcription of leanISA's channels rather than a second table.
Nothing else in `SatisfiedBy` is touched; the eighteen BLAKE2S value limbs are columns of
`blake2sTable` there and virtual columns here (finding F3 of the status file), reconciled by
`FlockInterface.limbColumns`.

**With the Flock roadmap (#3).** This roadmap owns the single stacked WHIR, its parameters, the
Merkle trees and the transcript, and consumes Flock plus ring switching as `FlockInterface`. #3
owns the BLAKE2s circuit, the R1CS lowering, zerocheck, lincheck, ring switching in the leanVM
lane, and their security theorems; its F6 (the concrete PCS) is the generic `whirOpen` of
Layer 11, developed once and shared. The value `g_0` of the fixed zerocheck coordinates is a
Category B constant with no stated provenance (finding F2) and is #3's to transcribe.

**With recursion (T5, T6).** `verify` evaluates the bytecode multilinear and the Flock matrices
through `settleFixedClaims`; the recursive verifier replaces that one function by a deferred
claim and is otherwise `verify`. `VerifySummary`-style outputs (`cpu/mod.rs:690-704`) are not
modelled here.

## Ordering and parallelism

Layers 0, 2 and 5 are independent and can begin at once (Layer 5 needs Layer 0 only for the
`SampleableType E` instance, which may be stubbed with a parameter until Layer 0 lands, as
ArkLib's own protocols do). Layer 1 needs Layer 0. Layer 4 needs Layers 0 and 1. Layer 3 needs
Layers 1 and 2 and leanISA Layers 5–8. Layer 6 needs Layers 3 and 5; Layer 7 needs Layers 3, 4
and 6; Layer 8 needs Layer 3; Layer 9 needs Layer 3 and #3's definitions; Layer 10 needs
Layers 6–9. Layer 11 needs Layers 0 and 1 only, is the largest single piece, and should start
early. Layer 12 needs Layers 10 and 11; Layer 13 needs Layer 12 and leanISA Layer 10.

Each layer is one pull request (Layers 10 and 11 may be two), titled `feat(protocol): …`, and it
lands with `./scripts/validate.sh` green, its modules registered in `LeanerVM.lean` and
`tests/LeanerVMTests.lean`, and a description naming the layer, the sources and pin, the
category of each new definition, the ledger entries it touches, and the T4 obligation it feeds.
A generic layer's pull request links the ArkLib issue it will become.

## How work is tracked

- **This document** says what is wanted. It is edited by pull request and does not record
  history, status, or who is doing what.
- **[protocol-status.md](protocol-status.md)** says where things stand: coverage per layer,
  the frontier, the upstream ledger with issue numbers, open findings against the sources, and
  the decisions still pending. It is hand-maintained, headed by the commit it describes, and
  rewritten whole when a layer lands.
- **Issue [#12](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/leanerVM/issues/12)** is the dashboard: the
  layer checklist with one of *open / claimed / in review / landed* per layer, links to the
  intention issue and pull request of each, the upstream ledger, and the frontier. It links to
  this document and to the status file at `main`, holds nothing that is not in them, and is
  updated when the status file is. Where the issue and the files disagree, the files win.
- **To claim work**, open an issue titled `[Intention]: protocol — Layer N: …` listing the exact
  targets taken (declaration names from the layer), so the rest stays open, and link it from
  the dashboard; the dashboard line moves to *claimed*. One layer, or a slice of one, per
  intention. Close it with the pull request that lands the slice; the line moves to *in review*
  when the pull request carries `awaiting-review` and to *landed* when it merges.
- **To report a problem with this roadmap** — a wrong or unclear target, a source discrepancy, a
  missing prerequisite — open an issue titled `[Roadmap]: protocol — …` naming the layer and
  the acceptance test or convention it touches. Durable source discrepancies are also recorded
  in [leanvm-target.md](../leanvm-target.md).
- **To change this document**, open a pull request that edits it, titled `docs(protocol): …`,
  and reference the dashboard in the description; say which layer, acceptance test, ledger entry
  or convention it touches. A pull request that lands a layer rewrites
  [protocol-status.md](protocol-status.md) whole in the same change and ticks the layer on the
  dashboard. A decision taken on a pending item is written here, as the convention or
  acceptance test it settles, and removed from the status file and the dashboard.
- **Upstream work** is tracked in the ledger of the status file: each entry carries the ArkLib
  (or Clean, CompPoly) issue or pull request number once opened, and the leanerVM layer that
  deletes its local copy when the pin moves.
- Pull requests carry `awaiting-review` when the author is done and `awaiting-author` after a
  review that asks for changes; the reviewer runs the `leanerVM-review` skill's three passes
  (specification, fidelity, hygiene) and reads the changed modules in full.
